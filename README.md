# Stoke

An MPR helper.

## How to install

If you really want to...


### Install via MPR

Just clone `https://mpr.hunterwittenborn.com/packages/stoke-git/` and run `makedeb -si` 
or 
install it via `tap` (but that's too easy, who wants to do that?)

### Install directly

Download the binary:
`sudo curl -L https://github.com/Henryws/stoke/raw/master/stoke -o /usr/local/bin/stoke`

Set permissions:
`sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/stoke`

You're ready!


### Features
* Can install MPR dependencies (tap, I'm looking at you)
* Parsable, easy to script with
* All in one script (tap...)
