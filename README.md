# lolz

An ~~awesome~~ MPR helper.

## How to install

If you really want to...


### Install via MPR

Just clone `https://mpr.hunterwittenborn.com/packages/lolz-git/` and run `makedeb -si` 
or 
install it via `tap` (but that's too easy, who wants to do that?)

### Install directly

Download the binary:
`sudo curl -L https://github.com/Henryws/lolz/raw/master/lolz -o /usr/local/bin/lolz`

Set permissions:
`sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/lolz`

You're ready!
